These rules cannot be impacted or negated by\nbrowser quirks or edge-case HTML parsing unless the browser suffers a\ncatastrophic bug in its HTML parser or Javascript interpreter \u2014 both of\nthese are unlikely.\n\n\nThe contexts in which zend-escaper should be used are \nHTML Body\n, \nHTML\nAttribute\n, \nJavascript\n, \nCSS\n, and \nURL/URI\n contexts.\n\n\nEvery escaper method will take the data to be escaped, make sure it is utf-8\nencoded data (or try to convert it to utf-8), perform context-based escaping,\nencode the escaped data back to its original encoding, and return the data to\nthe caller.\n\n\nThe actual escaping of the data differs between each method; they all have their\nown set of rules according to which escaping is performed. An example will allow\nus to clearly demonstrate the difference, and how the same characters are being\nescaped differently between contexts:\n\n\n$escaper = new Zend\\Escaper\\Escaper('utf-8');\n\n// &lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;zf2&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;\necho $escaper->escapeHtml('<script>alert(\"zf2\")</script>');\n\n// &lt;script&gt;alert&#x28;&quot;zf2&quot;&#x29;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;\necho $escaper->escapeHtmlAttr('<script>alert(\"zf2\")</script>');\n\n// \\x3Cscript\\x3Ealert\\x28\\x22zf2\\x22\\x29\\x3C\\x2Fscript\\x3E\necho $escaper->escapeJs('<script>alert(\"zf2\")</script>');\n\n// \\3C script\\3E alert\\28 \\22 zf2\\22 \\29 \\3C \\2F script\\3E \necho $escaper->escapeCss('<script>alert(\"zf2\")</script>');\n\n// %3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22zf2%22%29%3C%2Fscript%3E\necho $escaper->escapeUrl('<script>alert(\"zf2\")</script>');\n\n\n\n\nMore detailed examples will be given in later chapters.\n\n\nThe Problem with Inconsistent Functionality\n\n\nAt present, programmers orient towards the following PHP functions for each\ncommon HTML context:\n\n\n\n\nHTML Body\n: \nhtmlspecialchars()\n or \nhtmlentities()\n\n\nHTML Attribute\n: \nhtmlspecialchars()\n or \nhtmlentities()\n\n\nJavascript\n: \naddslashes()\n or \njson_encode()\n\n\nCSS\n: n/a\n\n\nURL/URI\n: \nrawurlencode()\n or \nurlencode()\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, these decisions appear to depend more on what PHP offers, and if it\ncan be interpreted as offering sufficient escaping safety, than it does on what\nis recommended in reality to defend against XSS. While these functions can\nprevent some forms of XSS, they do not cover all use cases or risks and are\ntherefore insufficient defenses.\n\n\nUsing \nhtmlspecialchars()\n in a perfectly valid HTML5 unquoted attribute value,\nfor example, is completely useless since the value can be terminated by a space\n(among other things), which is never escaped. Thus, in this instance, we have a\nconflict between a widely used HTML escaper and a modern HTML specification,\nwith no specific function available to cover this use case. While it's tempting\nto blame users, or the HTML specification authors, escaping just needs to deal\nwith whatever HTML and browsers allow.\n\n\nUsing \naddslashes()\n, custom backslash escaping, or \njson_encode()\n will\ntypically ignore HTML special characters such as ampersands, which may be used\nto inject entities into Javascript. Under the right circumstances, the browser\nwill convert these entities into their literal equivalents before interpreting\nJavascript, thus allowing attackers to inject arbitrary code.\n\n\nInconsistencies with valid HTML, insecure default parameters, lack of character\nencoding awareness, and misrepresentations of what functions are capable of by\nsome programmers \u2014 these all make escaping in PHP an unnecessarily\nconvoluted quest.\n\n\nTo circumvent the lack of escaping methods in PHP, zend-escaper addresses the\nneed to apply context-specific escaping in web applications. It implements\nmethods that specifically target XSS and offers programmers a tool to secure\ntheir applications without misusing other inadequate methods, or using, most\nlikely incomplete, home-grown solutions.\n\n\nWhy Contextual Escaping?\n\n\nTo understand why multiple standardised escaping methods are needed, what\nfollows are several quick points; they are by no means a complete set of\nreasons, however!\n\n\nHTML escaping of unquoted HTML attribute values still allows XSS\n\n\nThis is probably the best known way to defeat \nhtmlspecialchars()\n when used on\nattribute values, since any space (or character interpreted as a space \u2014\nthere are a lot) lets you inject new attributes whose content can't be\nneutralised by HTML escaping. The solution (where this is possible) is\nadditional escaping as defined by the OWASP ESAPI codecs. The point here can be\nextended further \u2014 escaping only works if a programmer or designer knows\nwhat they're doing. In many contexts, there are additional practices and gotchas\nthat need to be carefully monitored since escaping sometimes needs a little\nextra help to protect against XSS \u2014 even if that means ensuring all\nattribute values are properly double quoted despite this not being required for\nvalid HTML.\n\n\nHTML escaping of CSS, Javascript or URIs is often reversed when passed to non-HTML interpreters by the browser\n\n\nHTML escaping is just that &mdsash; it's designed to escape a string for HTML\n(i.e. prevent tag or attribute insertion), but not alter the underlying meaning\nof the content, whether it be text, Javascript, CSS, or URIs. For that purpose,\na fully HTML-escaped version of any other context may still have its unescaped\nform extracted before it's interpreted or executed. For this reason we need\nseparate escapers for Javascript, CSS, and URIs, and developers or designers\nwriting templates \nmust\n know which escaper to apply to which context. Of\ncourse, this means you need to be able to identify the correct context before\nselecting the right escaper!\n\n\nDOM-based XSS requires a defence using at least two levels of different escaping in many cases\n\n\nDOM-based XSS has become increasingly common as Javascript has taken off in\npopularity for large scale client-side coding. A simple example is Javascript\ndefined in a template which inserts a new piece of HTML text into the DOM. If\nthe string is only HTML escaped, it may still contain Javascript that will\nexecute in that context. If the string is only Javascript-escaped, it may\ncontain HTML markup (new tags and attributes) which will be injected into the\nDOM and parsed once the inserting Javascript executes. Damned either way? The\nsolution is to escape twice \u2014 first escape the string for HTML (make it\nsafe for DOM insertion), and then for Javascript (make it safe for the current\nJavascript context). Nested contexts are a common means of bypassing naive\nescaping habits (e.g. you can inject Javascript into a CSS expression within an\nHTML attribute).\n\n\nPHP has no known anti-XSS escape functions (only those kidnapped from their original purposes)\n\n\nA simple example, widely used, is when you see \njson_encode()\n used to escape\nJavascript, or worse, some kind of mutant \naddslashes()\n implementation. These\nwere never designed to eliminate XSS, yet PHP programmers use them as such. For\nexample, \njson_encode()\n does not escape the ampersand or semi-colon characters\nby default. That means you can easily inject HTML entities which could then be\ndecoded before the Javascript is evaluated in a HTML document. This lets you\nbreak out of strings, add new JS statements, close tags, etc. In other words,\nusing \njson_encode()\n is insufficient and naive. The same, arguably, could be\nsaid for \nhtmlspecialchars()\n which has its own well known limitations that make\na singular reliance on it a questionable practice.",
